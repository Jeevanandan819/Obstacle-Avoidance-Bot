# Obstacle-Avoidance-Bot
This is a bot which avoids the obstacles present in its path by using the ultrasonic sensor for detecting the objects and it turns accordingly in a random way.The bot turns left or right when it is close enough (less than 20 cm) to any obstacle like wall.The main use of the ultrasonic sensor is to calculate the distatnce between the bot and the obstacle this data is used for controlling the bot.It is a fully automated i.e it does not require any inputs for control from the user.
